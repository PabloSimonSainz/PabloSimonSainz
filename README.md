<h1>About me</h1>

👋 Hello there! I'm Pablo Simón, machine learning engineer with a degree in computer science from the University of Burgos.

😄 I consider myself an empathetic and outgoing person, and I've always been good at working in a team. I like to do my best when I have a task, so I usually turn problems around until I find the best result (understanding each part from start to finish).

👨‍💻 My career has taught me to work in teams using AGILE methodologies and proper GIT version control. Working as a backend developer and data engineer has helped me to adapt to different technologies and to better understand projects and their lifecycle.

💕 I have always been passionate about maths, science and new technologies. What has led me to choose this profession is the fascination that I have for artificial intelligence, both because of all the engineering behind it and because of the enormous potential that it has. It's a world I want to learn more about the deeper I get. 

The other point is that it is part of the computing world. I find it a very healthy community and one where we are happy to help each other in a selfless way.

🎯 My current goal is to be a leader in the development of machine, so in my free time I am taking courses and certifications in a self-taught way and I am looking for projects where I can put the new knowledge into practice and strengthen the ones I have already learnt.
